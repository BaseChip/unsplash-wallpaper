# unsplash-wallpaper v1.1
One of my first python applications, which automatically downloads a wallpaper of unsplash.com to get yourself a nice looking desktop. Currently only working with Windows. Tested on Windows 10.

As this is GitHub, feel free to fork and open a pull request for other platforms.

## How to use
Download the zip file [here](https://github.com/tobimori/unsplash-wallpaper/releases/) and extract it.
Now simply execute the unsplash-wallpaper.exe file found in the releases tab of this repo.
To get an automatic changing wallpaper, just add this file to autostart.
